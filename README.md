# draVi
drawing tool using vim keybinds to enable drawing without mouse or touchscreen for simple tasks

## todo:
- [ ] base functionality
- [ ] find out how to enable systems to drawing using the entire keyboard as a selection tool.
- [ ] conversion to tikz or a similar typst system if that is possible

## idea
the idea is to enable drawing of simple stuff using cursor selection using the display to
cover through they keys so "q" is the left upper most key and "p" is the right-most upper key
etc.

then we need zoom and then drawing using those systems.

this might just be stupid enough to work.
